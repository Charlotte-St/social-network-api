## Installation

The app requires installation of Node.js, express, MongoDB, and mongoose. The app can be started from the command line using the command `npm run start`. An API client like Insomnia is required to interact with the database as there is no GUI. 

## Usage

- In an API client, add the URL for the route you would like to interact with. There is information about the routes available in the routes/api folder. 
- If required, enter the JSON object necessary to perform the instruction. There is information about the models available in the models folder.
